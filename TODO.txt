Think of automation of the following:
1. Changes are made for taxi code base
2. Changes are pushed to taxi_test image (i.e. was 1.0 now 1.1)
3. Image with new changes is launched on server in taxi_test to verify changes
4. Once changes are confirmed to work properly:
5. On PC new image of main taxi is being build to include tested changes and pushed
6. On server the new main taxi image is launched with new changes
(Bash script on PC and Aliases on server for startup?)
